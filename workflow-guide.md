## How Contribution/WorkFlow Works

#### Following is a guide on which thing, merges, where

If it's a:

1. MAJOR/BREAKING CHANGE feature (with an issue, created with tags, "feature" AND "major"/"breaking-change") - then you created an PR/MR for next-major branch

2. MINOR feature (with an issue, created with tags, "feature" AND "minor") - then you created an PR/MR for next-minor branch

3. VULNERABILITY/BUGFIX (with an issue, created with tags, "bug" OR "vulnerability") - then you created an PR/MR for next-fix branch

Long, Tedious process but works in the most organized way.
